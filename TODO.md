# Project TODO

A simple, in-repo task list using GitHub-friendly checkboxes. Keep it short and actionable.

## Conventions
- One line per task: use checkboxes, a short title, and optional metadata.
- Priority: [P0] critical, [P1] high, [P2] normal, [P3] low.
- Owner: @github-handle. Optional due date: YYYY-MM-DD.
- Link to issues/PRs if they exist to avoid duplication.
- Move completed items to “Done (recent)” at the bottom; prune periodically.
